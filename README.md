# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room needs to set up an environment for their game. They are trying to develop a web-based version of the gaming app. The client has requested specific software requirements such as having one or more teams involved, Multiple players for each team, Unique identifiers and only one instance of the game at a time

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe showing the development requirements for the different systems was my best part. It isnt perfect but I spent the most time and research on this area. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I really like the structured organization of the design document. You get very good points to do your research on. I like how it maps plans out all of the different areas of focus for developing a project. It broke things down into incremental steps and provides pretty much all of the information you need in one place. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
My interpretation of the UML diagram. I would make it more specific. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user needs by evaluating what they were saying and putting into the frame of programming. The user's needs not only help you with adding functions to your project but by eliminating a need others might have also. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Designing software is about having a good plan and building towards that goal. You find out the requirements and things then begin with your process. I would improve the planning phase. I want a clear blueprint of where we are trying to go. We can adjust from there.
